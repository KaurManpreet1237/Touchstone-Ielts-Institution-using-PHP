<h2>DELIVERING SUCCESSFUL LESSONS</h2>
<h3>Result orientation is Touchstone’s primary state of mind. We support an environment where we are accountable for
 the personal and collective growth of every student. Student learning and effective training are parts of the culture
 at Touchstone. </h3>

 <h2 style="font-size:50px;text-align:left;color:#006699;">HOW ARE WE RESULT-ORIENTED? </h2><br>
 <h3> 
	Level-based classes: Level-based classes at Touchstone ensure that every student connected 
	with us is important, learns at their own pace and does not have their learning confined to
	the level of others. Touchstone acknowledges the significant proficiency differences in every 
	individual that needs to be addressed regardless of their age and background
 </h3><br>
 <h3>
 Masterclasses: Touchstone’s masterclass philosophy places every student at the centre of the considerations
 of our curriculum and classroom practice. Our classes are goal-oriented and time-sensitive for students who
 are enthusiastic about achieving their goals. Our experts help them learn more about English proficiency 
 tests through Masterclasses and familiarise them with the assessment criteria. We further offer guidance
 on mistakes to avoid in different test parts and display an advanced level of English.
 </h3><br>
 <h3>
 Student support system: Student success and satisfaction are the main objectives of Touchstone Educationals.
 It is a Student-Touchstone ecosystem where both the students and Touchstone’s support team can connect with 
 each other to solve students’ queries and problems. This department is particularly dedicated to students’
 success and growth, ensuring they are best equipped to thrive in the English-speaking environment.
 </h3><br>
 <h3>
	Research-based mock tests: Our research-based mock tests are an exact replica of the real test in terms
	of timing, scoring and difficulty level. In simpler words, our mock tests are a simulation experience to
	prepare you for the real exam. Our mock tests are an important tool to map your progress, track daily 
	improvement and get an objective assessment of all the skills required in English proficiency tests.

<h2>Freedom to interact with the content</h2><br>
<h3>Touchstone is a teacher-led learning space with technology-enhanced classrooms. 
We provide an integrated learning experience with updated computers, student-response
 system and specialized software to foster excellent facilities for our students.
 Like a traditional class, our IDP-trained teachers provide front-of-class education 
 and the smart technologies enable students to interact better with the content.
Here we try to make classrooms come alive through audio-visual exposure to make learning more
 interesting for students.  </h3><br>
 <h2>Keeping students focused with our smart classrooms:</h2><br>
 <h3>Our smart classes are our way to keep students interested and motivated in class. 
 The modernized classrooms are endowed with top-class equipment and facilities to let 
 the educators take charge of the entire class and focus on every student. The expert

<h1 style="font-size:50px;text-align:left;color:#006699;">ONE-TO-ONE ATTENTION SYSTEM </h1><br>
<h3>The individual attention system at Touchstone enables our trainers to spot talent and give them their due credit. 
Every student is different, with different capacities to learn and avail opportunities to maximise their potential.
 We believe in the spark of every student and the key to igniting this secret door is individual attention. </h3>
<h2>Why individual attention?</h2>
<h3>Individual attention helps bridge the gap between the learning pace of students as the class progresses.
 This is done to minimize or prevent the feeling of isolation in students.  </h3><br>
 <h3>Benefits of the individualized attention system at Touchstone: </h3><br>
   <li>Opportunities for every single student </li>
   <li>Strengthened student-teacher bond</li>
   <li>Increased focus on each student</li>
   <li>Scope of improvement and opportunities</li>
   <li>Healthy class environment </li><br>
   <h2>Individualized attention for a strong foundation</h2><br>
   <h3>Open-ended discussion: Touchstone conducts timely open-ended discussions with students to encourage complete
   meaningful answers to understand their ideas, opinions, thoughts and feelings. This is done to make students
   understand that their contribution matters and strengthen their self-esteem. We help them be creative and use
   cognitive skills for better relationship-building with our support team. When students express themselves freely, 
   without restricting themselves to monosyllabic answers, is when our student support team takes notes of their pain
   areas to solve their problems.</h3>
